THE JUNGLE BOOK
"The Jungle Book is a Novel 
written by Rudyard Kipling!"
"The story of ""The Jungle Book""
 refers to a young man named
 MOWGLY!"
"The PANTHER Bagheera one day 
comes across
 an abandoned boat, in which a 
small baby is seen."
The boy was MOWGLY!
"Bagheera decided to take that 
boy to the pack of Wolves!"
He takes that boy and starts walking towards them!
"Bagheera handovers mowgly to a small
 family of wolves."
They adopt the boy
"Mowgly got easily involved and got
 engaged with wolves and..."
with all the animals in the Jungle.
"After 10 long years Mowgli grown up as 
 a young boy."
"The wolf pack knows Shere Khan's hatred
 (KING of the Jungle) towards Man."
", and they decide
 to send Mowgli away for protection."
"Bagheera takes responsibility to take Mowgli 
to a man-village."
"They decides to move out in a dark,
but there comes KAA."
KAA is a python which is expert at hypnotizing other animals.
KAA tries to hypnotize them in the night but...
Mowgly rans away easily from KAA!
Both of them take rest peacefully on that night!
"The next day, they are awakened by 
'The Dawn Patrol,' a pack of elephants."
"Mowgli spends a few moments with Hathi's son,
 who one day dreams of following in his Father's footsteps."
"Bagheera tells Mowgli to continue on
 their way to the man-village, but Mowgli refuses."
"After some struggles, Bagheera and Mowgli separate,
 fed up with the other's company."
"Then Mowgly is suddenly discovered by Baloo, 
a large bear."
Baloo is a bear with care free attitude.
"Bagheera hears them talking to each other 
and returns to that place."
Mowgly now wishes to stay with Baloo.
Group of Monkeys arrives there and...
Attacks the mowgly silently &...
Takes Mowgly away from that place.
and they take him to the ancient ruins.
"That particular area is handled by
orangutan named King Louie."
King Louie finds something interesting in him!
"He got to know that Mowgly belongs to
Man-cub and he can get his help in ..."
 Figuring out how to make fire.
"Bagheera and baloo shows up there
shortly!"
"They makes a plan to take out mowgly
from there!"
They do it by fighting with King Louie and 
by fighting with monkeys.
Mowgly thanks baloo!
"Bagheera and baloo discusses the 
potential threat to mowgly from Shere khan."
"Baloo in the end agrees to take mowgly
back! This wasn't promised."
"When mowgly finds about this 
He runs away!"
"After running through jungle, 
mowgly encounters Kaa."
KAA hypnotizes the Boy!
"Just about when he tries to eat boy
Shere khan appears."
"KAA tries to hide Mowgly from shere khan
while talking to him."
Shere khan leaves after talking with KAA.
"Then KAA tries to eat mowgly after
shere khaan leaves."
Mowgly escapes from there.
He keeps running away...
Through jungles...
Through Water...
Through trees...
All alone.
Here comes the Vultures in the picture!
"Mowgly talks with vultures about the issues
and other things he is been going through!"
They were willing to take him with them!
"As they were dicussing the things
There comes the SHERE KHAN!"
"Even after that, Mowgly doesn't runs!
 And everyone feels like SHERE KHAN will now hit him hard!"
"There comes THE GREAT Baloo
 for saving his friend, MOWGLY!"
Baloo fights with SHERE Khan.
"They both fought hardly,
 Shere khan hitting Baloo hard at first."
Baloo also responded back fiercely.
In this fight Baloo got injured badly!
"In all this thing clever Mowgly decides 
something to do!"
"In all this Chaos, mowgly takes away
Shere Khan's attention!"
"Mowgli ties a flaming branch to Shere Khan's tail, 
and the fire spooks the tiger, sending him running away."
Just when Mowgly thinks baloo got died...
Baloo woke up all of a sudden!
"Soon, Bagheera arrives there..."
"All three of them team up over there,
and they set off back through the Jungle."
"They enjoy the journey happily while
 travelling back to the Jungle."
They enjoyed in water...
On trees...
and randomly while Walking...
"Everyone thought that Bagheera's plan to take 
mowgly back to the Man village has been failed."
"Everything was going normal when all
 three of them hear something."
Mowgly looks around but couldn't found anything.
Mowgly gets terrified and baloo makes fun of him!
"After some days, mowgly forgets about that Incident."
They continue their time spending on a happy side.
"Again on a random day, Mowgly hears something!"
"When he sees it through the bushes, it made
 him so much happY!"
"He saw a girl, a little girl , gathering water."
"He decides to go for more closer look so
 he walks down..."
That little girl pretends to spill her water jug.
She does it again!
and again!
He looked at her once!
and started walking towards her.
Mowgly refills that water jug for her!
and tries to give it to her.
She does take that from mowgly but...
"gives it back to HIM and
 started walking towards the Man-Village."
Baloo whispers mowgly to come back but ...
"Bagheera discusses this with Baloo and tells him 
that Mowgly is at a place where is actually belongs!"
And both of them started walking back towards the Jungle.
THE END!
